DirTreeMirror_PrdPrjSw:
  cmm/mv/__init__.py
This package-name (mv) stands for "moving".

Here are organized the scripts
  related to adhoc moving files from source to destination.
The difference from this package to "mir" (mirroring) is
  that the moves here are adhoc ones, i.e., more related to
  batch-moving than to mirroring or backing up.

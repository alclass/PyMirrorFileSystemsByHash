DirTreeMirror_PrdPrjSw:
  cmm/trans/__init__.py
This package-name (trans) stands for "transformation".

Here are organized the scripts
  related to changing or transforming filenames (or perhaps even file contents)
  in a dirtree.
  Examples:
     1 - video compression: takes a videofile and creates another one but compressed
     2 - audio extraction (at this time, this script is in the user's bin folder, but will be moved to here later on)
     3 - rename-filenames scripts (*)

  (*) Most rename-filenames scripts are also in the user's bin, but this package is ideal for receiving them in the future

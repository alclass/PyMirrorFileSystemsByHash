This package-name (rep) stands for "reporting".

Here are organized the scripts
  related to showing information about source and destination dirtrees.
  Examples:
     1 - reporting the repeat files in a certain dirtree
     2 - reporting the missing source files in destination
     3 - reporting repeat ytid's
       (this last example in particular is for YouTube id's, not necessarily a repeat.)
